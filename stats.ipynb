    "To introduce this topic we will consider a practical example.  You are in London and want to get from Coram's Fields to King's Cross station.  You have two options: walk or take the Piccadilly line from Russel Square to King's Cross.  If you walk, you can expect it to take 14 minutes with an uncertainty of +/- 1 minute (standard deviation).  Model this as a Gaussian distribution and make a plot.  Tip: look at https://numpy.org/doc/2.3/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.normal.html with a large size to get a smooth distribution and make sure you add enough bins to the histogram"
